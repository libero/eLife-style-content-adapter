            <title>Introduction</title>

            <p>Fossil hominins were first recognized in the Dinaledi Chamber in the Rising Star cave system in
                October 2013. During a relatively short excavation, our team recovered an extensive collection of
                1550 hominin specimens, representing nearly every element of the skeleton multiple times (Figure
                1), including many complete elements and morphologically informative fragments, some in
                articulation, as well as smaller fragments many of which could be refit into more complete
                elements. The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be attributed to no
                previously-known hominin species. Here we describe this new species, <italic>Homo
                naledi</italic>. We have not defined <italic>H. naledi</italic> narrowly based on a
                single jaw or skull because the entire body of material has informed our understanding of its
                biology.

                    <p>The figure includes approximately all of the material incorporated in this diagnosis,
                        including the holotype specimen, paratypes and referred material. These make up 737 partial
                        or complete anatomical elements, many of which consist of several refitted specimens.
                        Specimens not identified to element, such as non-diagnostic long bone or cranial fragments,
                        and a subset of fragile specimens are not shown here. The ‘skeleton’ layout in the center
                        of the photo is a composite of elements that represent multiple individuals. This view is
                        foreshortened; the table upon which the bones are arranged is 120-cm wide for scale.

                <p>The word <italic>naledi</italic> means ‘star’ in the Sotho language and refers to
                    the Dinaledi Chamber's location within the Rising Star cave system.

                <title>Locality</title>

                <p>The Dinaledi chamber is located approximately 30 meters underground, within the Rising Star
                    cave system at about 26°1′13′′ S; 27°42′43′′ E. The system lies within the Malmani dolomites,
                    approximately 800 meters southwest of the well-known site of Swartkrans in the Cradle of
                    Humankind World Heritage Site, Gauteng Province, South Africa.

                <p>The present sample of skeletal material from the Dinaledi Chamber was recovered during two
                    field expeditions, in November 2013 and March 2014.
                </p>

                <p>Six specimens from an ex situ context can be identified as bird bones, and few fragmentary
                    rodent remains have been recovered within the excavation area. Neither of these faunal
                    constituents can presently be associated with the hominin fossil collection (Dirks et al.,
                    2015).
                </p>

                <p>Aside from these limited faunal materials, the Dinaledi collection is entirely composed of
                    hominin skeletal and dental remains. The collection so far comprises 1550 fossil hominin
                    specimens, this number includes 1413 bone specimens and 137 isolated dental specimens; an
                    additional 53 teeth are present in mandibular or maxillary bone specimens. Aside from the
                    fragmentary rodent teeth, all dental crowns (n = 179) are hominin, recovered both from surface
                    collection and excavation. Likewise, aside from the few bird elements, all morphologically
                    informative bone specimens are clearly hominin. In all cases where elements are repeated in the
                    sample, they are morphologically homogeneous, with variation consistent with body size and sex
                    differences within a single population. These remains represent a minimum of 15 hominin
                    individuals, as indicated by the repetition and presence of deciduous and adult dental
                    elements.
                </p>

                <p>The geological age of the fossils is not yet known. Excavations have thus far recovered
                    hominin material from Unit 2 and Unit 3 in the chamber (Dirks et al., 2015). Surface-collected
                    hominin material from the present top of Unit 3, which includes material derived from both Unit
                    2 and Unit 3, represents a minority of the assemblage, and is morphologically indistinguishable
                    from material excavated from in situ within Unit 3. In addition to general morphological
                    homogeneity including cranial shape, distinctive morphological configurations of all the
                    recovered first metacarpals, femora, molars, lower premolars and lower canines, are identical
                    in both surface-collected and excavated specimens (see Figure 14 later in the text). These
                    include traits not found in any other hominin species yet described. These considerations
                    strongly indicate that this material represents a single species, and not a commingled
                    assemblage.
