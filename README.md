## Dependencies

## Getting started
This project provides a `Makefile` with short commands to run common tasks.
Typically, MacOS and most Linux distributions come with [gnu make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
installed. If are unable to run the commands below because your system doesn't 
have `gnu make` installed, you can try to install it or copy and paste commands
found in the `Makefile` into your command line interface.

* `make help` for a full list of commands.
* `make start` builds and/or runs the site locally configured for development purposes.
* `make stop` stops containers and cleans up any anonymous volumes.
